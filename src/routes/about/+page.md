## What I'm Doing Now

I'm a front-end engineer with a keen interest in crafting beautiful user-friendly digital experiences.

My journey into software development started many years ago when I stumbled upon a C programming book on my dad's shelf during my high school years. Back then, I was fascinated that I could tell a computer what to do just by writing code.

Today, I specialize in creating web applications with Svelte and React. I've created my personal website to share my writings and some of my latest work. As for my future goals, I'm broadening my expertise to full-stack web development using technologies such as Elixir to learn how to build scalable systems and learning more about visual design to craft better user interfaces.

## My Previous Chapter: Grad School

Before entering tech, I spent a few years as a graduate student. At Rice University, I earned my Master of Science in Applied Physics, focusing on studying the optical properties single-walled carbon nanotubes using ultrafast spectroscopy. My original ambition was to finish a PhD and enter academia. But, I later recognized that academia wasn't the best path for me in the long-term.

## Hobbies That Shape Me
Outside of programming and web development I enjoy:
- **Photography:** My favorite genres include landscape and street photography. 📷
- **Writing:** Penning thoughts in my diary or blogging, writing sharpens my clarity and focus. ✍🏾
- **Sci-fi media:** *The Expanse* is my favorite TV series. 🚀
- **Traveling:** It's on my bucket list to visit Iceland, Japan, and the Maldives. 🌍
- **Video games:** I love the *Spider-man* series on PS5. 🎮
