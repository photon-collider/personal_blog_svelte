# About Me

Hi! I'm Bryan Anthonio. I am a PhD student in the applied physics program at [Rice University](https://rice.edu). I started this blog to develop the habit of writing more regularly. This, for me, provides a means of sharing my personal interests and chronicling my past experiences. I am also using this website as a way to learn a bit more about web development as I am aiming to add more features to my website down the road.

Outside of work, my personal interests include photography, computer programming, writing and cooking. I do also enjoy reading articles about philosophy and technology as well as watching documentaries, particularly those about history. I look to forward to going into more details about these facets of my life in future blog articles.
