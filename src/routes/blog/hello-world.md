Hello, World! This marks my first post on my new blog. In putting together this blog, I decided to try my hand at building a website from scratch rather than use a website template. It is not the first time that I have built a website before, but it has certainly been my most ambitious project in the realm of web development. At the moment, I am feeling quite elated to have finally finished the first version of this website. Furthermore, I could not have pulled off this feat without relying on the help of the static site builder [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) which made the process of developing this website relatively pleasant.

In the meantime, I have already finished adding an [About Me](/about/) section where you can learn a bit more about myself. So far, I am still in the process of drafting new articles and I look forward to posting them here soon. Thank you for tuning in!
