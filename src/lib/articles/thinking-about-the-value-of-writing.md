How does writing give value to readers? I haven’t thought much about this question in the years of my writing education. However, I pondered this more seriously after watching a [lecture presented by Larry McEnerney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM), the director of the writing program at the University of Chicago.

McEnerney remarked that despite having several years of practice and instruction, many students don’t develop adequate writing skills. He explained that this occurs because students aren’t taught how to produce writing that offers value to readers.

I found this very relatable. While I was student, I often wrote at the behest of instructors and standardized exams. The purpose of these writings was often to answer a prompt on a book or an article. On rare occasions, I was given the creative freedom to research a topic of interest and write about that.

In these assignments the purpose wasn’t about giving value to readers. I wrote to demonstrate that I knew what I was talking about and that I could write well, according to a grading rubric. My audience was comprised of instructors whose job it was to give me a grade.

## What is Valuable Writing?

The value of a piece of writing depends on the audience. In classroom settings, instructors are typically the only audience members. As a result, students write a lot for people who, in McEnenery’s words, are paid to care about each student’s writing. Outside of the classroom, writers have to convince readers why they should care about what they’ve written.

Good writing educates readers or changes their minds on a particular topic. McEnerney argued that most writing courses don’t emphasize this enough as students often write about topics that their instructors already know very well.

He also noted that good writing possesses value, persuasiveness, organization and clarity. In my education, the emphasis was often placed on the latter three. Perhaps this is because these are easier to teach and to evaluate in a grading rubric. While much of this is relevant to academic writing, where does writing for a personal blog fits in this discussion?

## The Value of Writing a Blog

Personal blogs present an interesting case in that they function like a public diary. This often means the author may also be part of the intended audience. I’ve learned that one area where a blog can surpass a diary is in sharing knowledge, not only with yourself as the author but also with your readers. It’s commonly said that one of the best ways to learn is to teach. Thus, writing what you’ve learned can help you better understand the material.

This forms the essence of what it means to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). By writing about your journey in learning a new concept, a blog post can act as a platform to teach others who were once in your shoes. It can also provide an opportunity for people who have more expert knowledge on your topic to offer feedback and further guidance.

Getting started on learning in public can be daunting but there are a few ways to get started. As [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/) writes, two ways include include writing about your ongoing projects and writing short form “Today I learned” posts about any small thing you’ve learned.

For me, learning in public is the one of the most valuable aspects of writing for my blog. I’m aiming to gett into the spirit of documenting what I’ve learned, a practice that I haven’t always maintained consistently. Indeed, there are many things I wish to learn and many others who I hope to share this journey with.
