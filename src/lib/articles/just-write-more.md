description: Exploring my struggles with perfectionism in my writing, and my commitment to overcome it through consistent practice.

What’s the best way to improve your writing? Just write more often. This advice makes sense and yet, I’ve struggled to follow it.

I’ve been too ambitious whenever I write a new post for my blog. I constantly aim for each post to be written well, perfectly structured, and full of original ideas. As a result, I write less often because of the unnecessary pressure I put on myself. I’m now aiming to publish more regularly and worry less about writing perfect blog posts.

This experience reminds me of my struggles when I first started photography. In those days, my photos didn’t impress me. This is because I didn’t yet understand techniques for composing images and hadn’t identified a genre of photography to focus on. I felt aimless. 

Finding clarity required effort. I took lots of pictures and experimented with different styles of photography. Soon, I realized my love for landscape photography and developed my photographic eye. I’m going to take a similar approach to writing. 

Writing and publishing more frequently will help me grow as a writer. With every new article I publish, I hope to come closer to identifying what I enjoy writing about most and developing my writing voice. I don’t want this journey to be about achieving perfection. In embracing this process, I hope to connect more authentically with my thoughts and my readers.
