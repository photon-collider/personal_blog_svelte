Here lies the source code for my personal website at [bryananthonio.com](bryananthonio.com). I've created this repo here so you can have a look around if you'd like and/or suggest ways to improve this website.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
