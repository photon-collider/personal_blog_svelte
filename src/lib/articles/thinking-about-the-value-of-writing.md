How does writing give value to readers? I don't think I thought much about this question when I first learned how to write. However, I pondered this more seriously after watching a [lecture by Larry McEnerney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM), the director of the writing program at the University of Chicago.

McEnerney remarked that despite several years of practice and instruction, many students haven't developed adequate writing skills. He explained that this occurs because students haven't learned how to produce writing that offers value to readers.

I found this very relatable. While I was a student, I often wrote at the behest of instructors and standardized exams. The purpose of these writings was often to answer a prompt regarding a book or an article. On rare occasions, I had the creative freedom to research a topic of interest and write about that.

In these assignments, the purpose wasn’t to give value to readers. I wrote to demonstrate that I knew what I was talking about and that I could write well, according to a grading rubric. My audience included instructors tasked with giving me a grade.

## What is Valuable Writing?

The value of a piece of writing depends on the audience. In classroom settings, instructors are typically the only audience members. As a result, students write for people who, in McEnenery’s words, are paid to care about their students' writing. Outside the classroom, writers must convince readers to care about their writing.

After all, good writing educates readers or changes their minds on a particular topic. McEnerney argued that most writing courses don’t emphasize this as students often write about topics that their instructors already know very well.

He also noted that good writing possesses value, persuasiveness, organization, and clarity. Writing education curricula focus on the latter three. Perhaps this is because these are easier to teach and evaluate in a grading rubric. Much of this is relevant to academic writing. But where does writing for a personal blog fit in this discussion?

## The Value of Writing a Blog

Personal blogs present an interesting case in that they function like a public diary. Thus, blogs can provide an avenue to practice writing for more diverse audiences beyond just course instructors. But one area where a blog surpasses a private diary is by sharing knowledge, not only with yourself as the author but also with your readers.

A common adage states that one of the best ways to learn is by teaching. Thus, writing about what you’ve learned can help you better understand the material.

This concept captures what it means to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). By writing about your journey in learning new things, a blog post functions as a platform to teach others who were once in your shoes. Doing this can be as simple as [writing about your struggles](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/05/24/blog-about-what-you-ve-struggled-with/) in learning new concepts or [writing short-form TIL posts](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/) about anything you recently learned. It can also provide an opportunity for people possessing more expert knowledge on your topic to offer feedback and further guidance.

Learning in public is one of the most valuable aspects of writing for my blog. Indeed, there are many things I wish to learn. Documenting the new skills I've learned will not only benefit my future self but will also help others benefit from any insights I've gained along the way.
