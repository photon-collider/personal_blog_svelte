    Hi! I'm Bryan Anthonio. I started this blog to develop the habit of writing more regularly. This, for me, provides a means of sharing my personal interests and chronicling my past experiences. I am also using this website as a way to learn a bit more about web development as I am aiming to add more features to my website in the future.

    Outside of work, my personal interests include photography, technology, computer programming,
    and writing. I do also enjoy reading articles about philosophy and technology as well as
    watching documentaries, particularly those about history. I look to forward to writing more
    about these topics in future blog posts.

    If you would like to send some feedback or just say hello, feel free to reach out to me via
    email at **hello** at **bryananthonio.com**.
