What do you think of when you hear the word “ambiguity”? Some people regard it as an adversary to conquer. For others, the concept might evoke feelings of being trapped in a maze. I used to have such feelings. 

But after reading the book [*Navigating Ambiguity*](https://dschool.stanford.edu/book-collections/navigating-ambiguity) by Andrea Small and Kelly Schmutte, I’ve since understood that ambiguity isn’t to be feared. Indeed, it fuels creativity.

Ambiguity arises when the end goal for a project isn’t defined with extreme precision. This provides room to experiment with multiple approaches. For instance, in writing, you might rewrite a sentence or paragraph several ways until it feels just right. 

This freedom lends a personal touch to creative work and uncovers surprising possibilities. Yet, I haven’t always found it easy to accept. 

I previously struggled to embrace ambiguity because of my perfectionism. As a result, I would rush to the obvious solution to a challenge and perfect it, instead of permitting myself to discover other directions. Nowadays, I treat the open-ended aspects of my projects as opportunities to go beyond the obvious. 

For instance, when planning vacations, I no longer immediately pick one destination. I first brainstorm a list of potential destinations and eliminate a few of these after researching fun activities and the best times to travel to each place. Only then do I make a final selection.

I’ve also found creative exploration necessary in doing web design. This has pushed me to experiment with different fonts, layouts, and visual motifs to see what matches the brand I’m designing for. 

With that being said, too much ambiguity hinders progress. If the breadth of potential avenues is endlessly vast, it becomes cumbersome to identify which ones to explore. 

These instances require a clearer vision, which necessitates setting narrower constraints. Doing so empowers you to leverage ambiguity as a bridge towards meaningful opportunities for innovation. 

Ambiguity is a crucial ingredient in all creative endeavors. Treat it as an asset rather than a deficit. Lean into it to add a personal touch to your work and discover innovative approaches you wouldn’t have thought possible. Constrain it when it hinders your progress. In doing so, you’ll transform the unknown into a canvas for your imagination.
