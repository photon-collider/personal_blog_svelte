A well-structured sitemap can be a game changer for search engine optimization (SEO). If youâ€™ve built your blog using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), you may wonder how to create a sitemap using this framework. While the [official documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/seo#manual-setup-sitemaps) briefly introduces sitemap generation, it doesn't provide some key details. In this post, I will describe all the steps needed to create one for a blog site. 

## What is a Sitemap?

A sitemap is a map to all the pages, videos, and other content on your website. They are helpful as web crawlers use site maps to efficiently identify and index content on a website. [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview) recommends generating a sitemap if:
- Your website has 500+ pages.
- Your website is new and hasn't been indexed.
- Your website contains a lot of rich media content, such as video and images, or is featured in Google News.

Even if your website doesn't meet these criteria, providing a sitemap can get your website indexed faster, especially if you [submit it to the Google Search Console](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap#addsitemap). 

## Steps to Generate a Sitemap
### Prerequisites

In this tutorial, I'll assume you have a basic understanding of how [routing](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing)  works in SvelteKit. 

### Create the Sitemap Route

First, let's create the route `/sitemap.xml`. We can do this by making a new directory called `sitemap.xml` in the `routes/` folder in your project. In this directory, create a `+server.js` file. Here, we'll define a server-side action to generate the sitemap. This can be done by implementing the `GET` function shown below:

```javascript
// src/routes/sitemap.xml/+server.js
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
export const prerender = true // needed only if using SvelteKit's static adapter

export async function GET() {
    const navHeaderLinks = ["/", "/blog", "/about", "/projects"]
	const blogPostLinks = getBlogPostLinks()
	const linkItems = [...navHeaderLinks, ...blogPostLinks]
	const sitemap = generateSitemap(linkItems);
	return new Response(sitemap, {
		headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/xml' },
	})
}
```

The `navHeaderLinks` and `blogPostLinks` represent arrays of strings, where each string corresponds to an internal link on the website. In this example, the `navHeaderLinks` array corresponds to links that appear in the navigation menu. These include the home, blog, projects, and about pages which correspond to the strings `"/"`, `"/blog"`, `"/projects"`, and `"/about"`, respectively. Furthermore, if there's a blog post at the route `/blog/blog-post-example`, the `blogPostLinks` array will contain the string `"/blog/blog-post-example"`. Because the routes for blog posts are typically generated dynamically, we will gather these separately.

<Aside>
As a side note, if you're using SvelteKit as a static site generator, be sure to include the expression <code> export const prerender = true</code>.

### Gather All Website Links

To gather the blog post links, we need the Node functions `fs.readdirSync` and `path`. These will be used to read the directory containing the blog posts. Here, let's assume that the directory `src/lib/posts` contains markdown files for each post and that the names of these markdown files correspond to the blog post slugs.  

The goal here is to extract the slugs for each of the blog posts. The `getBlogPostLinks` function defined below captures this logic:

```javascript
function getBlogPostLinks(){
	const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'src/lib/articles');
	const filenames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);
	const blogPostLinks = filenames.map(file => {
		const slug = file.replace(/\.md$/, '');
		return `/blog/${slug}`
	});
	return blogPostLinks
}
```

### Generate Sitemap Contents

Finally, let's define a function to generate the sitemap using the links:

```javascript
function generateSitemap(linkItems) {
    const siteURL = 'https://example-domain-name.com'
	const sitemapEntries = linkItems.map(link => `<url><loc>${siteURL}${link}</loc></url>`.trim()).join('');

	let sitemap = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"> ${sitemapEntries}
	</urlset>`;

	sitemap = sitemap.replace(/\n/g, '') //remove newline characters
	return sitemap;
}
```
This function assumes that the website is hosted at the domain given by `siteURL`.
